# Revolve

A discord.js bot used in [Kinkdom](http://discord.gg/kinkdom).


## Features

Revolve focuses mostly on moderative tasks. Here's a list of key features:

* Provides a thorough response to a user when they post their intro, letting them know how they can improve.
* Neatly logs server activity to console and to server channels.
* Allows a member to toggle assignable roles to their liking.
* Provides commands for staff to use to approve new users and to reset roleplay rooms.


## Upcoming

One of the current goals is to make the bot simple to configure for other servers. The bot was designed with Kinkdom in mind, so various ids are hard coded into the id .json files. I'm hoping to slowly move away from this, and towards a more general purpose application, without sacrificing its functionality on Kinkdom.

Further documentation will be made.

See the [Project board](https://github.com/kinkdom-org/Revolve/projects/1) for new, upcoming features.
